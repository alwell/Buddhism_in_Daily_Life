The Dhamma 
==========

The second of the Three Gems Buddhists take their refuge in is the
Dhamma. When they take their refuge in the Dhamma they say: “Dhamma
saraṇa gacchāmi”, which means, “I go for refuge to the Dhamma.”

What does the word “dhamma” mean? Most people think that dhamma only
means doctrine, but the word “dhamma” has several more meanings. Dhamma
means everything which is real, no matter whether it is good or bad.
Dhamma comprises, for example, seeing, sound, greed and honesty. We
cannot take our refuge in every dhamma; for instance we cannot take our
refuge in greed or hate.

Can we take refuge in our good deeds? The effect of a good deed is never
lost, since each good deed will bring its fruit accordingly. In the
Kindred Sayings (I, Sagāthā-vagga, Ch I, part 8, Slaughter Suttas, par
5) we read that a deva (divine being) asks the Buddha how a man should
live so that he does not have to fear life in another world. The Buddha
answered:


 
     Let him but rightly set both speech and mind.                  
     And by the body work no evil things. 
     If in a house well stored with goods he dwel
     Let him have faith(17), be gentle, share his good 
     With others, and be affable of speech. 
     In these four qualities if he persist, 
     He need not fear life in another world.


A good deed can cause a happy rebirth such as birth in the human plane
of existence, or in a heavenly plane, and in that case one need not fear
life in another world. However, even a heavenly plane is not a permanent
refuge. Life in a heavenly plane may last very long, but it is not
permanent. There may be rebirth in unhappy planes after one’s lifespan
in a happy plane is terminated, depending on which of one’s accumulated
good and bad deeds, kusala kamma and akusala kamma, will produce
result[(18)](#FOOT18). Each deed will bring its own result: a wholesome
deed will bring a pleasant result and an unwholesome deed will bring an
unpleasant result. Some deeds may produce a result in this life, other
deeds may produce result in a future life. The accumulated unwholesome
and wholesome deeds may cause births in different planes of existence at
different times. In the Kindred Sayings (I, Sagāthā-vagga, Ch III,
Kosala, Part 2, par 10, Childless) we read about someone who gave alms
to a Pacceka Buddha. Because of this good deed he was reborn in heaven
seven times and after that in the human plane, which is also kusala
vipāka. However, he killed his nephew because he wanted his brother’s
fortune. This ill deed caused him to be reborn in hell. Thus he received
the results of kusala kamma and of akusala kamma at different times.

So long as all defilements and latent tendencies have not been
eradicated, there will be rebirth in different planes of existence. Even
those who are reborn in heavenly planes still have defilements and
latent tendencies. Birth is sorrow, no matter in what plane; birth will
be followed by death. We read in the Kindred Sayings (II, Nidāna-vagga,
Ch XV, part 1, par 3, Tears) that the Buddha, while he was in the Jeta
Grove, near Sāvatthī, said to the monks:

Incalculable is the beginning, monks, of this faring on. The earliest
point is not revealed of the running on, faring on, of beings cloaked in
ignorance, tied to craving.

As to that, what do you think, monks? Which is greater, the flood of
tears shed by you crying and weeping as you fare on, run on this long
while, united as you have been with the undesirable, separated as you
have been from the desirable, or the waters in the four seas?

…For many a long day, monks, have you experienced the death of mother,
of son, of daughter, have you experienced the ruin of kinsfolk, of
wealth, the calamity of disease. Greater is the flood of tears shed by
you crying and weeping over one and all of these, as you fare on, run on
this many a long day, united with the undesirable, separated from the
desirable, than are the waters in the four seas.

Only when all defilements have been eradicated will there be no cause
any more which can produce a next life; that is the end of rebirth , and
that means the end of all sorrow. Nibbāna is the end of rebirth because
nibbāna is the end of defilements[(19)](#FOOT19) . Therefore one can
truly take one’s refuge in nibbāna. In the suttas, nibbāna is called
“the deathless”. We read in the Kindred Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Book I,
Kindred Sayings on the Way, I, Ignorance, par 7) that, when the Buddha
was at Sāvatthī, a monk said to him:

> “ ’The deathless! The deathless!’, lord, is the saying. Pray, lord,
> what is the deathless, and what the way to the deathless?”
>
> “That which is the destruction of greed, the destruction of hatred,
> the destruction of ignorance, monk -that is called ’the deathless’.
> This same ariyan eightfold way is the way to the deathless.”

Nibbāna is the dhamma we can take our refuge in, nibbāna is included in
the second Gem. Nibbāna is a Gem of the highest value, because there is
nothing to be preferred to complete freedom from all sorrow, from birth,
old age and death. Nibbāna is real. If one has not yet attained
enlightenment, one has not experienced nibbāna. But if one follows the
right Path one may realize nibbāna, even during this life.

Nibbāna is the deathless, it is the end of the cycle of birth and death.
People may think that is not very desirable not to be born again. It
does not make much sense to speculate about nibbāna; if we have not
attained enlightenment we cannot imagine what nibbāna is like. At the
present time we can experience our defilements; we can experience the
sorrow which is caused in the world by greed, hatred and ignorance. We
read in the Kindred Sayings (I, Sagāthā-vagga, Ch III, Kosala, Part 3,
par 3, the World) that, when the Buddha was at Sāvatthī, King Pasenadi
asked him:

> “How many kinds of things, Lord, that happen in the world, make for
> trouble, for suffering, for distress?”
>
> “Three things, sire, happen of that nature.
>
> What are the three?
>
> Greed, hatred and ignorance: these three make for trouble, for
> suffering, for distress.”

Who does not want to be free from suffering, caused by greed hatred and
ignorance? Those who want to become free from all defilements take
refuge in nibbāna. What is the Path leading to nibbāna? Nibbāna cannot
be attained merely by wishing for it. Can people attain nibbāna by doing
good deeds? Even when one performs good deeds there can still be the
idea of self. When one does good deeds but there is no development of
right understanding of realities, the belief in a self and other
defilements cannot be eradicated. Thus, good deeds alone, without right
understanding, cannot lead to nibbāna. Only vipassanā can lead to the
attainment of nibbāna, to the eradication of defilements.

On may wonder whether it is necessary, in addition to developing
vipassanā, to do other good deeds. There is no self who can choose to
perform a particular kind of kusala. The Buddha encouraged us to perform
all kinds of kusala for which there is an opportunity. Sometimes there
is an opportunity for dāna, sometimes for sīla, at other times for
samatha or for vipassanā. Through the development of vipassanā we will
come to know our defilements, even the more subtle ones. Then we will
see the danger of defilements more clearly and realize the benefit of
developing the Path leading to their eradication. If we observe the
precepts or do other kinds of good deeds with mindfulness of nāma and
rūpa, we will learn that there is no self who performs kusala and thus
kusala will be purer. However, vipassanā will not immediately transform
one’s character. It is most important to develop right understanding of
both kusala and akusala as only conditioned realities, as non-self.

The development of vipassanā takes many lives, because ignorance is
deeply accumulated. Most of the time we are ignorant and forgetful of
the nāma and rūpa which appear now through one of the five senses or
through the mind-door. We are used to thinking of realities which have
fallen away already a long time ago or of those which may present
themselves in the future. We should not expect to learn awareness in one
day or even within one year. We cannot tell how much progress is made
each day, because wisdom develops very gradually.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (III, Khandhā-vagga, Middle Fifty, Part
5, par 101, Adze-handle) that the Buddha, when he was at Sāvatthī, said
to the monks:

> By knowing, monks, by seeing is, I declare, the destruction of the
> āsavas[(20)](#FOOT20) , not by not knowing, by not seeing...
>
> Suppose, monks, in a monk who lives neglectful of self-training there
> should arise this wish: ”O that my heart were freed from the āsavas
> without grasping.” Yet for all that his heart is not freed from the
> āsavas. What is the cause of that?
>
> It must be said that it is his neglect of self-training. Self-training
> in what? In the four applications of mindfulness…in the ariyan
> eightfold Path.
>
> …in the monk who dwells attentive to self-training there would not
> arise such a wish as this: “O that my heart were freed from the āsavas
> without grasping”; and yet his heart is freed from them. What is the
> cause of that?
>
> It must be said it is his attention to self-training…Just as if,
> monks, when a carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice looks upon his
> adze-handle and sees thereon his thumb-mark and his finger-marks he
> does not thereby know: ”So and so much of my adze-handle has been worn
> away today, so much yesterday, so much at other times.” But he knows
> the wearing away of it just by its wearing away.
>
> Even so monks, the monk who dwells attentive to self-training has not
> this knowledge: “So and so much of the āsavas has been worn away
> today, so much yesterday, so much at other times.“ But he knows the
> wearing away of them just by their wearing away.

When wisdom is highly developed, nibbāna can be realized. There are four
stages of enlightenment and at each stage nibbāna is experienced and
defilements are progressively eradicated. Defilements are so deeply
rooted that they can only be eradicated stage by stage. At the first
stage the wrong view of self is eradicated, but there are still
attachment, aversion and ignorance. Only at the last stage of
enlightenment, the stage of the arahat, are all defilements and latent
tendencies eradicated completely. When one has attained the stage of the
arahat there will be no more rebirth.

The citta which experiences nibbāna is a “supramundane” or lokuttara
citta. There are two types of citta for each of the four stages of
enlightenment: lokuttara kusala citta and its result, the
“fruition-consciousness”; thus there are eight types of lokuttara citta.
Nibbāna and the eight types of lokuttara citta which experience nibbāna
are included in the second Gem, the Dhamma to which one goes for
refuge[(21)](#FOOT21). When we take our refuge in the second Gem, we
consider it the goal of our life to develop the wisdom which can
eventually eradicate all defilements.

There is still another Dhamma included in the second Gem, namely the
Dhamma in the sense of the Buddha’s teachings. We can take our refuge in
the Buddha’s teachings. The teachings can lead people to the truth if
they study them with right understanding and if they practise according
to what is taught. We should study the whole of the Buddha’s teachings.
If one studies only a few suttas one will not clearly understand what
the Buddha taught. Many times a sutta merely alludes to things which are
explained in detail in other parts of the Tipiṭaka, the “three
Collections” of the scriptures. It is useful to study the commentaries
to the Tipiṭaka as well, because they explain the Buddha’s teachings.
The teachings are our guide since the Buddha passed away.

We read in the Discourse to Gopaka-Moggallāna (Middle Length Sayings
III, no. 108) that after the Buddha’s passing away a brahman asked
Ānanda what the cause was of the unity of the monks. He said:

> “Is there, good Ānanda, even one monk who was designated by the good
> Gotāma, saying: ’After my passing this one will be your support’, and
> to whom you might have recourse now?”
>
> “There is not even one monk, brahman, who was designated by the Lord
> who knew and saw, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, saying:
> ’After my passing this one will be your support’, and to whom we might
> have recourse now.”
>
> “But is there even one monk, Ānanda, who is agreed upon by the Order
> and designated by a number of monks who are elders, saying: ’After the
> Lord’s passing this one will be our support’, and to whom you might
> have recourse now?”
>
> “There is not even one monk, brahman, who is agreed upon by the
> Order... and to whom we might have recourse now.”
>
> “But as you are thus without support, good Ānanda, what is the cause
> of your unity?”
>
> “We brahman, are not without support, we have a support, brahman.
> Dhamma is the support.”

In the Gradual Sayings (Book of the Threes, Ch VI, par 60, Sangārava) we
read that the Buddha spoke to the brahman Sangārava about three kinds of
“marvels”: the marvel of “superpower”, such as diving into the earth or
walking on water, the marvel of thought-reading and the marvel of
teaching. The Buddha asked him which marvel appealed to him most.
Sangārava answered:

> Of these marvels, master Gotama, the marvel of super-power…seems to me
> of the nature of an illusion. Then again as to the marvel of
> thought-reading…this also, master Gotama, seems to me of the nature of
> an illusion. But as to the marvel of teaching…of these three marvels
> this one appeals to me as the more wonderful and excellent.

The teachings are the greatest miracle because they can change a
person’s life. Through the Dhamma one is able to follow the Path which
eventually leads to the end of all sorrow, to the end of the cycle of
birth and death. The Buddha’s teachings do not appeal to everyone. Many
people find it difficult to think in a way which is different from the
way they used to think. They do not like the truth of non-self. They
want to be master of their mind even though they can find out that this
is impossible. The Buddha knew how difficult it is for people to change
their way of thinking. In the Discourse to Vacchagotta on Fire (Middle
Length Sayings II, no. 72) we read that the Buddha, when he was staying
near Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, taught Dhamma to Vacchagotta who had
wrong views. Vacchagotta, after having brought forward his wrong views
and having listened to the Buddha’s reply, said that he was at a loss
and bewildered on account of what the Buddha had said to him. The Buddha
replied:

> You ought to be at a loss, Vaccha, you ought to be bewildered. For,
> Vaccha, this dhamma is deep, difficult to see, difficult to
> understand, peaceful, excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle,
> intelligible to the wise; but it is hard for you who are of another
> view, another allegiance, another objective, of a different
> observance, and under a different teacher.

Dhamma is deep and difficult to understand. People cannot understand
Dhamma if they still cling to their own views. If they would really
study the teachings and apply what they have learnt, they could find out
for themselves whether one can take one’s refuge in the Dhamma. When we
have verified in our life that what the Buddha taught is reality, even
if we cannot yet experience everything he taught, we do not want to
exchange our understanding for anything else in life. If we develop
right understanding of realities we will have Dhamma as a support. Thus
we take refuge in the Dhamma.
