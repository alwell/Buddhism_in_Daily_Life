Death 
=====

It is a reality of life that we are bound to lose those who are dear to
us. When a relative or one of our friends dies we feel much grief and we
find it difficult to bear our loss. The Buddha’s teachings can help us
to face reality, to see things as they are. Many times the Buddha spoke
about the sorrow caused by the loss of dear people.

We read in the Discourse on Born of Affection (Middle Length Sayings II,
87):

> Thus have I heard: At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in
> the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the dear
> and beloved little only son of a certain householder had passed away.
> After he had passed away (the father) had no inclination for work or
> for food. Going constantly to the cemetery, he wailed: “Where are you,
> little only son? Where are you, little only son?” Then that
> householder approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the
> Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. The Lord spoke thus to
> that householder as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:
>
> “Do you not have, householder, controlling faculties for stilling your
> own mind? There is a change in your faculties.”
>
> “But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord? For, Lord, my
> dear and beloved little only son has passed away...”
>
> “That is just it, householder. For, householder, grief, sorrow,
> suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in
> affection.”
>
> “But for whom Lord, could this hold good in this way: ’Grief, sorrow,
> suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in
> affection’? For, Lord, bliss and happiness are born of affection,
> originate in affection.”
>
> Then the householder, not rejoicing in what the Lord had said,
> repudiating it, rising from his seat, departed...

The householder could not grasp the deep meaning of the Buddha’s words.
We should try to understand what the Buddha meant. We should try to
understand what the Buddha taught about the world, about ourselves,
about life and death. The Buddha summarised his teachings in the “Four
Noble Truths”.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Book XII, Kindred Sayings
about the Truths, Ch II, par 1) that the Buddha explained the “Four
Noble Truths” (ariya sacca) to his first five disciples in the Deerpark
in Vārānasi. The first “Noble Truth” is the Truth of “dukkha” which can
be translated as suffering or unsatisfactoriness. The Buddha said:

> Now this, monks, is the ariyan truth about dukkha:
>
> Birth is dukkha, decay is dukkha, sickness is dukkha, death is dukkha;
> likewise sorrow and grief, woe, lamentation and despair. To be
> conjoined with things we dislike, to be separated from things we like
> that also is dukkha. Not to get what one wants -that also is dukkha.
> In a word, the five khandhas which are based on grasping are dukkha.

The five khandhas, which are the mental phenomena and the physical
phenomena in and around ourselves, are dukkha. One may wonder why they
are dukkha. We take the mind for self, but what we call our mind are
only mental elements or nāmas which arise and then fall away
immediately. We take the body for self, but what we call our body are
only physical elements or rūpas which arise and fall away. When we do
not know the truth we think that these phenomena can stay; we take them
for self. We might for instance think that sadness stays, but there is
not only sadness, there are many other phenomena such as seeing, hearing
and thinking. What we think is a long time of sadness is, in reality,
many different phenomena succeeding one another; none of these phenomena
stays.

Phenomena which are impermanent are not real happiness; so they are
dukkha. Although dukkha is often translated as “suffering”, it is not
only an unhappy feeling; the first “Noble Truth” pertains to all
phenomena which arise and fall away. There is not anything in our life
which is not dukkha. Even happy feeling is dukkha; it does not last.

The second “Noble Truth” is the origin of dukkha, which is craving. The
same sutta states:

> Now this, monks, is the ariyan truth about the arising of dukkha: It
> is that craving that leads back to birth, along with the lure and the
> lust that lingers longingly now here, now there: namely the craving
> for sensual pleasure, the craving to be born again, the craving for
> existence to end. Such, monks, is the ariyan truth about the arising
> of dukkha.

So long as there is craving in any form there will be a condition for
life, for the arising of nāma and rūpa. Thus, there will be dukkha.

The third “Noble Truth” is the cessation of dukkha, which is nibbāna. We
read in the above quoted sutta:

> And this, monks, is the ariyan truth about the ceasing of dukkha:
>
> Verily it is the utter passionless cessation of, the giving up, the
> forsaking, the release from, the absence of longing for this craving.

Craving is the origin of dukkha, whereas when there is the cessation of
craving there will be the extinction of rebirth and thus of dukkha.
Nibbāna is the end of dukkha. The arahat has, at the attainment of
enlightenment eradicated all craving and thus for him there are no more
conditions for rebirth, and that means the end of dukkha[(27)](#FOOT27).

We read in the same sutta about the fourth “Noble Truth”:

> Now this, monks, is the ariyan truth about the practice that leads to
> the ceasing of dukkha:
>
> Verily it is the ariyan eightfold way, namely: Right understanding,
> right thinking, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
> effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

The eightfold Path (ariya-magga) is the development of right
understanding of all phenomena which appear in our daily life. We come
to know the world in and around ourselves, not through speculation, but
from our own experience.

How do we experience the world? We experience the world through seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting, receiving impressions through the bodysense
and through the mind. Everything we experience through the doors of the
five senses and through the mind-door is extremely short, because all
phenomena which arise fall away immediately. When we see, there is the
world of visible object, but it does not last, it falls away again. When
we hear, there is the world of sound, but it is impermanent. Likewise
the world of smell, the world of taste, the world of tangible object and
the world of mental objects; none of these worlds lasts.

In the Visuddhimagga (VIII, 39) we read about the shortness of the
world:

> …in the ultimate sense the life-moment of living beings is extremely
> short, being only as much as the occurrence of a single conscious
> moment. Just as a chariot wheel, when it is rolling, rolls (that is,
> touches the ground) only on one point of (the circumference of) its
> tyre, and, when it is at rest, rests only on one point, so too, the
> life of living beings lasts only for a single conscious moment. When
> that consciousness has ceased, the being is said to have ceased...


                                      
                        
	 Life, person, pleasure, pain-just these alone                            
	 Join in one conscious moment that flicks by.                             
	 Ceased khandhas of those dead or alive                                   
	 Are all alike, gone never to return. 
	 No (world is) born if (consciousness is) not                             
	 Produced, when that is present, then it lives;                           
	 When consciousness dissolves, the world is dead...                       
                                  


What we call death is not really different from what happens at any
moment of consciousness. Each moment a citta falls away there is death
of citta. Each citta which arises falls away completely but it
conditions the next citta. The last citta of this life, the
dying-consciousness (cuti-citta), is succeeded by the first citta of the
next life, the rebirth-consciousness (paṭisandhi-citta). There is no
self at any moment of our life and thus there is no self or soul which
travels from this life to the next life.

It is ignorance which causes us to think and behave as if the body and
the mind were permanent. We are attached to the body and to the mind and
we take them for self. We think that it is self who sees, hears, thinks
and moves around. The clinging to self causes sorrow. We wish to be
master of our body and our mind; we wish to control our life and to
experience only pleasant things. When we are confronted with old age,
sickness and death we are very sad. Those who are ignorant of reality
cannot grasp the Buddha’s words that sorrow originates in attachment.
This is in fact the second “Noble Truth”, the truth about the
origination of dukkha which is craving. We should realize that all nāmas
and rūpas which arise are impermanent, dukkha and anattā (non-self).

The Buddha pointed out the impermanence of phenomena in many different
ways. He spoke about the impermanence of the body in order to help
people to become detached from the concept of “my body”. He spoke about
the contemplation of the foulness of the body, and he recommended
meditations on corpses in different stages of dissolution. We read in
the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta (Middle Length Sayings I, no. 10):

And again, monks, as a monk might see a body thrown aside in a cemetery,
dead for one day or for two days or for three days, swollen,
discoloured, decomposing; he focuses on this body itself[(28)](#FOOT28),
thinking: “This body, too, is of a similar nature, a similar
constitution, it has not got past that (state of things).”

The Visuddhimagga (Ch VI, 88) explains:

> …For a living body is just as foul as a dead one, only the
> characteristic of foulness is not evident in a living body, being
> hidden by adventitious embellishments.

In order that people might realize the foulness of the living body as
well, the Buddha spoke about the “Parts of the Body”. We read in the
Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta:

> And again, monks, a monk reflects on precisely this body itself,
> encased in skin and full of various impurities, from the soles of the
> feet up and from the crown of the head down, that: “There is connected
> with this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin,
> flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes,
> spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentary, stomach, excrement, bile,
> phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, serum, saliva, mucus, synovic
> fluid, urine.”

Reflections on the foulness of the body can help us to become less
attached to it, but the most effective way to see the body as it really
is, is awareness and direct understanding of the rūpa-elements which
constitute the body. We read in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta that the Buddha
spoke about the body in terms of the four elements:

> And again, monks, a monk reflects on this body according to how it is
> placed or disposed in respect of the elements, thinking: “In this body
> there is the element of extension, the element of cohesion, the
> element of heat, the element of motion.”

The element of extension or solidity (Earth) appears in the
characteristics of hardness and softness, the element of cohesion
(Water) in the characteristics of fluidity and cohesion, the element of
heat (Fire) in the characteristics of heat and cold, the element of
motion (Wind) in the characteristics of motion or oscillation and
pressure. These elements are the same, no matter whether we experience
them in dead matter or in the body. Both dead matter and the body are
only elements which are impermanent and non-self.

We should know the world as it really is by experiencing different
characteristics of nāma and rūpa when they present themselves through
the five sense-doors and through the mind-door. For example, when the
characteristic of heat presents itself through the bodysense, it can be
object of awareness. When softness appears it can be object of
awareness. In this way we will get to know different characteristics of
reality through our own experience and we will learn to see them as
elements.

It is important to know different characteristics of realities when they
present themselves in order to eliminate the clinging to the concept of
self. We may think that the softness of the body belongs to “my body”.
When we learn to be mindful of the characteristic of softness more often
we will find out that softness is a characteristic which is the same in
dead matter and in the body. We will learn through experience that it is
a characteristic which does not know or experience anything; that it is
rūpa and not self. Thus we will become less attached to the concept of
“my body”. When we are aware of realities such as seeing, sadness,
happiness and thinking, we will learn that they are only different types
of nāma which arise and fall away. They are dukkha. The eye is dukkha,
seeing is dukkha, the feelings which arise on account of what is seen
are dukkha.

It does not appeal to everybody to be mindful of nāma and rūpa as they
appear in daily life. However, we have to consider what we really want
in life. Do we want to continue being ignorant and taking body and mind
for self? Do we want to live in darkness or do we want to develop wisdom
so that there will be an end to dukkha? If we decide that we want to
walk the way leading to the end of dukkha, we must develop wisdom in our
daily life: when we see, hear or think, when we feel sad and when we
feel happy. This is the only way to understand dukkha, the arising of
dukkha, the ceasing of dukkha and the way leading to the ceasing of
dukkha. When we realize how deeply rooted our ignorance is and how
strong the attachment to the self, we will be motivated to learn to be
mindful of nāma and rūpa.

The Buddha often spoke about mindfulness of death. He spoke about death
in order to remind people of the impermanence of each moment. Life is
extremely short and thus we should not waste any time, but we should
learn to develop understanding of the present moment so that ignorance
of realities can be eliminated.

Ignorance cannot be eradicated within a short time. Only when one has
attained the fourth and last stage of enlightenment, the stage of the
arahat, are there no more defilements; only then ignorance is completely
eradicated. We read in the Mahā-Parinibbāna-sutta (Dialogues of the
Buddha II, no. 16, Ch VI, 10,11)[(29)](#FOOT29) that when the Buddha
passed away those who still had conditions for sorrow wept:

> Then, when the Bhagavā[(30)](#FOOT30) had passed away, some monks, not
> yet freed from passion, lifted up their arms and wept; and some,
> flinging themselves on the ground, rolled from side to side and wept,
> lamenting: “Too soon has the Bhagavā come to his parinibbāna! Too soon
> has the Happy One come to his parinibbāna! Too soon has the Eye of the
> World vanished from sight!”
>
> But the monks who were freed from passion, mindful and clearly
> comprehending, reflected in this way: “Impermanent are all compounded
> things. How could this be otherwise?”
>
> And the venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks, saying: “Enough,
> friends! Do not grieve, do not lament! For has not the Bhagavā
> declared before, that with all that is dear and beloved there must be
> change, separation and severance? Of that which has arisen, has come
> into being, is compounded and subject to decay, how can one say: ’May
> it not come to dissolution’ ?”

We read in the same sutta (Ch II, 32) that prior to his passing away the
Buddha said to Ānanda:

> Now I am frail, Ānanda, old, aged, far gone in years. This is my
> eightieth year and my life is spent…Therefore, Ānanda, be an island to
> yourself, a refuge to yourself, seeking no external refuge; with
> Dhamma as your island, Dhamma as your refuge, seeking no other refuge.
>
> And how, Ānanda, is a monk an island to himself, a refuge to himself,
> seeking no external refuge; with Dhamma as his island, Dhamma as his
> refuge, seeking no other refuge?
>
> When he dwells contemplating the body in the body, earnestly, clearly
> comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome desire and sorrow
> in regard to the world; he dwells contemplating feeling in the
> feelings, mind in the mind, and mental objects in the mental objects,
> earnestly, clearly comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome
> desire and sorrow in regard to the world, then, truly, he is an island
> to himself, a refuge to himself, seeking no external refuge; having
> Dhamma as his island and refuge, seeking no other refuge...

When we “contemplate” the body in the body, feeling in the feelings,
mind in the mind and mental objects in the mental objects, we will learn
not to see the self in the body, feelings, mind and mental objects. Only
if we are mindful of all the different kinds of nāma and rūpa which
present themselves in our daily life will we see that they are
impermanent, dukkha and anattā. This is the only way leading to the end
of dukkha, to the end of death.
