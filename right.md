Right Understanding in Daily Life 
=================================

What is the effect of the Buddha’s teachings on people’s actions? In
what way could the Buddha’s teachings effectively help people to perform
wholesome deeds? Is it possible to do good deeds because a person with
authority tells us: “Be detached and do good deeds”?

From experience we know that a good example might help to some extent,
but the source of the good deeds is within ourselves: our mentality
determines our actions. If someone wants to do his utmost to help other
people he should understand himself first. He should understand the
causes which make him act in this or in that way. If he develops right
understanding of these causes he will be able to lead a more wholesome
life and to help other people in the most effective way.

Mentality is the source from which deeds spring; it is therefore not
possible to determine the degree of wholesomeness from the outward
appearance of deeds alone. There are many gradations of wholesomeness
depending on the mentality which motivates a good deed.

Some people give money to needy people, but that does not mean that
there may not still be conceit or other selfish motives. Others give
without conceit, but they may still have attachment: they give only to
people they like. There are people who give out of pure loving-kindness,
without any thought of attachment. This is a more wholesome way of
giving.

We may wonder whether the study of so many details is necessary. In
daily life we will see that it is very helpful to know the different
kinds of citta and to know which citta motivates which kind of action.
Cittas change all the time, succeeding each other very rapidly. If we
learn to distinguish different kinds of citta, we will see that even
while we are performing a wholesome deed, unwholesome cittas can follow
very closely upon the wholesome cittas.

“Wholesome” is the translation of the Pāli term “kusala”. A wholesome
deed in its widest sense means a deed which brings no harm to oneself
nor to other people at the moment the deed is done or later on.

In the Discourse on the Foreign Cloth (Middle Length Sayings II, no. 88)
we read about wholesome deeds, wholesome speech and wholesome thoughts.
King Pasenadi questions Ānanda about the nature of unwholesome and
wholesome deeds. As to wholesome or “skilled” bodily conduct we read the
following conversation:

> “But what, revered sir, is skilled bodily conduct?” “Whatever the
> bodily conduct, sire, that has no blemish.” “But what, revered sir, is
> the bodily conduct that has no blemish?” “Whatever the bodily conduct,
> sire, that is non-injurious.” “And what, revered sir, is the bodily
> conduct that is non-injurious?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire,
> that is joyous in result.” “And what, revered sir, is the bodily
> conduct that is joyous in result?” “Whatever bodily conduct, sire,
> does not conduce to the torment of self and does not conduce to the
> torment of others and does not conduce to the torment of both, and by
> which the unskilled states dwindle away, the skilled states increase
> much...”

The same is said about wholesome speech and wholesome thinking. These
words render the meaning of wholesome or “kusala” in its widest sense.
There are many kinds and intensities of kusala. In developing “right
understanding” or wisdom there can be kusala of a higher degree.

Wisdom or understanding is a translation of the Pāli term “paññā ”.
Paññā does not only mean knowledge acquired from the study of books,
paññā also includes insight, right understanding of the realities of
daily life. Paññā can be developed in daily life. When paññā accompanies
kusala citta, wholesome citta, there is a higher degree of
wholesomeness. There are many degrees of paññā and each degree brings
its result accordingly.

It is a typical Buddhist approach to investigate and to be aware of the
different mental phenomena and physical phenomena which can be
experienced through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind. If one
is not used to this approach one might feel somewhat bewildered at
first. However, after we have investigated more these mental and
physical phenomena, we will find out that only thus it is possible to
understand the different ways in which we ourselves and other people
behave, and to know which causes bring which effects in life. It makes
no sense to speak in vague, general terms about realities, because the
real understanding of our experiences in life can never be developed in
that way.

Someone told me about a monk who was preaching in a way which was of
great help to people in their daily lives. When I asked what the monk
was preaching, the answer was that he was speaking about “citcai”.
“Citcai”[(7)](#FOOT7) is the word in Thai for “state of mind”, in Pāli:
citta. This monk had the right approach to life. One should follow the
example of the Buddha; one should not only tell people to do good deeds,
but one should teach them as well how to do good deeds. In order to know
how to do good deeds, we should go back to the source of the good deeds:
the mental states or “cittas”. It is preferable to use the Pāli term
“citta” rather than a translation from the Pāli since translations do
not render the meaning of the terms adequately. For example, the English
translation of “citta” as “state of mind” or “mental state” implies
something which stays, which does not change. But this is not the
characteristic of citta. When we have learned more about cittas we will
find out that there is no citta which stays, even for a second. Each
citta which arises falls away immediately, to be succeeded by the next
citta. Cittas determine our life and the lives of other people; they
condition the actions we perform in life.

Many people are not used to this approach; they are used to looking at
the outward appearance of things. Scientists are very advanced in the
study of outer space, but little is known about what goes on inwardly in
man. People are used to paying attention to the things they see and
hear, but they are not used to attending to seeing-consciousness and to
hearing-consciousness. They do not think of the cittas which perform the
functions of seeing and hearing.

Seeing-consciousness and hearing-consciousness are realities and
therefore it is important to know more about them. That part of the
Buddhist teachings which analyses and explains in detail mental
phenomena and physical phenomena is called the “Abhidhamma”. The
Abhidhamma deals with everything which is real. Studying the Abhidhamma
can change one’s life.

Many Thais listen to lectures about Abhidhamma, and not only those who
have been educated at a college or university, but also those who have
never received a higher education. I have heard of cases in which the
study of different cittas has helped people to lead a more wholesome
life. I heard of someone who was at first inclined to have feelings of
revenge towards other people, but who was gradually able to overcome
those feelings by understanding what those feelings were. Many Thais
know about the realities taught in the Abhidhamma, and they are able to
apply their knowledge in daily life. Foreigners do not usually hear
about this because people do not often speak about Abhidhamma to
foreigners.

Unwholesome mental states or “akusala cittas” and wholesome mental
states or “kusala cittas” are realities of daily life. In order to know
more about these realities we should try to understand ourselves first:
if we do not understand ourselves we cannot help other people. This does
not mean, however, that we have to wait our whole life before we can
start helping other people. Even those who are just beginning to
understand things as they are can help others to have right
understanding too.

Paññā, wisdom or understanding, is the opposite of ignorance, the root
of all defilement and sorrow. Paññā is important for the development of
kusala cittas. It is possible to do good deeds without paññā , but if
there is understanding of what is unwholesome and what is wholesome, and
understanding of what the result is of unwholesome and wholesome deeds,
one is able to lead a more wholesome life. Thus, the development of
paññā is of great benefit both to ourselves and to others.

There are many degrees of paññā . When a teacher explains to his pupils
that kusala cittas with gratitude or honesty will bring a pleasant
result and that unwholesome deeds motivated by greed or anger will bring
an unpleasant result, the explanation may be the condition for them to
have some degree of paññā . With paññā they may be able to develop
kusala cittas and to perform more wholesome deeds.

There is a higher degree of paññā when people realize the impermanence
of all the things they enjoy in life. When people see how short human
life is, they will try not to be attached too much to the pleasant
things of life. This understanding will stimulate them to a greater
generosity and to more readiness to help other people. They will be less
selfish.

Some people who have this degree of paññā might change their way of life
and live contentedly without any luxury. Others might decide to “go
forth from home into homelessness”; they might decide to become a monk.
A monk’s life is not an easy life. He lives without family and is one
who is “contented with little”. In the Discourse on the Sixfold
Cleansing (Middle Length Sayings III, no. 112) we read that the Buddha
spoke about the monk who told of his renunciation of the world:

> “So I, your reverences, after a time, getting rid of my wealth,
> whether small or great, getting rid of my circle of relations, whether
> small or great, having cut off my hair and beard, having put on
> saffron robes, went forth from home into homelessness...”

The Buddha explained that people are too much attached to the
sense-impressions received through eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body. He
spoke about the “five strands of sense-pleasures”. We read in the
Discourse with Subha (Middle Length Sayings II, no. 99) that the Buddha
spoke with Subha about the five strands of sense-pleasures:

> …These five, brahman youth, are the strands of pleasures of the
> senses. What five? Material shapes cognizable by the eye, agreeable,
> pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring.
> Sounds cognizable by the ear…Smells cognizable by the nose…Tastes
> cognizable by the tongue…Touches cognizable by the body, agreeable,
> pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring.
> These, brahman youth, are the five strands of sense-pleasures. Brahman
> youth, the brahman Pokkharasāti of the Upama––a (clan) of the Subhaga
> forest glade, is enslaved and infatuated by these five strands of
> sense-pleasures, he is addicted to them, and enjoys them without
> seeing the peril (in them), without knowing the escape (from them)...

We would like to have pleasant sense-impressions and we are inclined to
attach too much importance to them. We are so absorbed in what we see or
hear that we forget that sense-impressions are not true happiness. In
the Discourse to Māgandiya (Middle Length Sayings II, no. 75) we read
that the Buddha said to Māgandiya:

> Now I, Māgandiya, when I was formerly a householder, endowed and
> provided with the five strands of sense-pleasures, revelled in them...
> But after a time, having known the coming to be and passing away of
> sense-pleasures and the satisfaction and peril of them and the escape
> as it really is, getting rid of the craving for sense-pleasures,
> suppressing the fever for sense-pleasures, I dwelt devoid of thirst,
> my mind inwardly calmed. I saw other beings not yet devoid of
> attachment to sense-pleasures who were pursuing sense-pleasures
> (although) they were being consumed by craving for sense-pleasures,
> burning with the fever for sense-pleasures. I did not envy them: I had
> no delight therein...

People who understand that there is a higher happiness than the
pleasures which one can enjoy through the five senses might apply
themselves to the development of calm or “samatha”. The calm which is
developed in samatha is temporary freedom from attachment, anger and
other defilements. There are several meditation subjects of samatha,
such as recollection of the Buddha’s virtues, mindfulness of breathing
or loving-kindness. It depends on a person’s accumulations which subject
conditions calm for him. Samatha is not a matter of just trying to
concentrate on an object. Most important is right understanding of the
meditation subject and of the way to attain the calm which is wholesome
by means of the meditation subject. If one does not know the difference
between kusala citta and akusala citta one is likely to take attachment
to silence for kusala and then samatha cannot be developed. One has to
know the characteristic of calm which is wholesome, free from akusala.
Then there can be conditions for more calm. Calm in samatha can reach
such a high degree that one becomes totally absorbed in the meditation
subject. There are different stages of this calm absorption or “jhāna”.
During jhāna one does not receive impressions through the five senses
and thus one is at those moments not enslaved to them. One enjoys a
higher happiness. In higher stages of jhāna one attains a greater
tranquillity of mind until one no longer feels rapture or joy; one
transcends happy feeling and there is equanimity instead. When, however,
the citta is not jhānacitta, there are sense-impressions again.

Samatha is a means for the cultivation of wholesomeness. People who
apply themselves to samatha may become very peaceful and amiable. They
can be of great comfort to people who are restless. However, in samatha
defilements are not eradicated. Although one is not enslaved to
sense-impressions during the time of jhāna, one still clings to them
when the citta is no longer jhānacitta. The jhānas do not last; they are
impermanent. Moreover, there is a more subtle form of clinging, a
clinging to the happiness of the jhānas. One might think that one is
without clinging when one does not indulge in sense-pleasures. However,
one might still cling to the joy of jhāna which is not associated with
sense-pleasures, one might cling to pleasant feeling or equanimity which
can accompany jhānacitta.

For the development of samatha paññā is necessary, but this kind of
paññā cannot eradicate defilements. There is a higher paññā which can
eradicate all defilements, even the most subtle forms of clinging. This
paññā is developed in “insight meditation” or “vipassanā”. In vipassanā,
paññā gradually eliminates ignorance, the root of all defilements. One
learns more about the realities which present themselves through eyes,
ears, nose, tongue, body­sense and mind at any moment. We know so little
about the most common things of daily life. How often are we aware of
bodily movements during the day? How often are we aware of bodily
phenomena such as hardness or softness while we are stretching or
bending our arms, or when we are moving our lips while talking? We do
not really know what sound is, what hearing is or what it is we take for
“self” while hearing. We do not know the phenomena which appear at the
present moment.

When we are absorbed in the outer appearance and the details of things,
we will not be able to be aware of the realities of the present moment.
So long as we are carried away by like or dislike of what we see and
hear, it is impossible to see things as they are. It is as if we are
asleep; we are not yet awake to the truth. The Buddha was perfectly
mindful and he had complete knowledge of all the different kinds of
mental and physical phenomena. Therefore he could call himself “the
Awakened One”; he was fully awake to the truth. We, too, should wake up
to the truth.

In vipassanā, paññā will gradually develop and it will know things as
they are. In being aware of the reality which appears at the present
moment we learn that there are two kinds of reality: physical phenomena
or rūpa and mental phenomena or nāma. Rūpa does not know anything
whereas nāma experiences something; it experiences an object. For
example, visible object is rūpa; it does not know anything. Seeing is a
type of nāma; it experiences an object: visible object. Hearing and
thinking are other types of nāma, different from seeing. There are many
different types of nāma and rūpa, and in vipassanā we learn to
experience their characteristics.

In the development of vipassanā the impermanence of nāmas and rūpas will
be directly known. One may have reflected before on the impermanence of
all things in life. Reflection on the truth is necessary, but it is not
the same as the direct knowledge of the impermanence of all realities in
and around oneself. In the beginning the arising and falling away of
nāma and rūpa cannot be realised. However, if we learn to be aware of
different characteristics of nāma and rūpa which appear one at a time,
and if we realize that each nāma or rūpa which appears now is different
from preceding nāmas and rūpas, we will be less inclined to think that
nāma and rūpa last, and we will be less inclined to take them for
“self”.

In the Greater Discourse of a Full Moon (Middle Length Sayings III, no.
109) we read that the Buddha, while he was staying near Sāvatthī in the
palace of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, said to the monks:

> “…What do you think about this, monks? Is material shape permanent or
> impermanent?”
>
> “Impermanent, revered sir.”
>
> “But is what is impermanent painful or is it pleasant?”
>
> “Painful, revered sir.”
>
> “And is it right to regard that which is impermanent, suffering,
> liable to change, as ’This is mine, this am I, this is myself’?”
>
> “No, revered sir.”
>
> The Buddha asked the same about mental phenomena.

In the Discourse on Mindfulness of the Body (Middle Length Sayings, III,
no. 119) we read that the Buddha, when he was staying near Sāvatthī, at
the Jeta Grove, spoke to the monks about mindfulness of the body and the
advantages of it. Some of these are the following:

> …He is one who overcomes dislike and liking, and dislike (and liking) do
not overcome him; he fares along constantly conquering any dislike (and
liking) that have arisen. He is one who overcomes fear and dread, and
fear and dread do not overcome him; and he fares along constantly
conquering any fear and dread that have arisen. He is one who bears
cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of gadfly, mosquito, wind and sun,
creeping things, ways of speech that are irksome, unwelcome; he is of a
character to bear bodily feelings which, arising, are painful, acute,
sharp, shooting, disagreeable, miserable, deadly...

We will gradually learn to give in less to attachment and to anger or
aversion when we have realized that these are only different types of
nāma which arise because of conditions and then fall away again
immediately.

We should not wait to develop insight, right understanding of realities,
until we are old or have retired from our work. When we develop this
wisdom we will know ourselves better, we will be aware more often of the
moments of akusala cittas which arise, even while we are doing good
deeds. Conceit about our good deeds may arise or we may expect something
in return for our good deeds, such as praise or a good name. When we
gradually see more clearly that there are only nāma and rūpa which arise
because of conditions, there will eventually be less clinging to a
concept of self who performs kusala or akusala. When there is less
clinging to the self good deeds will become purer. The paññā developed
in vipassanā is the “Right Understanding” of the eightfold Path which
leads to nibbāna. Everyone has to tread this Path by himself. One can
only purify oneself. One cannot be purified by other people; other
people can only help one to find the right Path. There will be no
lasting world peace so long as there is craving, ill-will and ignorance.
It is very necessary to take part of the world organisations which
promote the peace and the welfare of nations, and to give material aid
to those who are in need. However, we should realize that this is not
enough, that it will only help to a certain degree. The real causes of
war are craving, ill-will and ignorance. Only in developing paññā can we
eliminate craving, ill-will and ignorance.

The eightfold Path leads to nibbāna. Nibbāna is the end of all
defilements. It can be realized here and now, in this life. When paññā
has been developed stage by stage it can reach the degree that
enlightenment can be attained. At that moment nibbāna is
experienced[(8)](#FOOT8). When one has realized nibbāna one understands
what it means to be “awakened to the truth”.
