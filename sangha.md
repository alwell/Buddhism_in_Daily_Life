The Sangha 
==========

The Sangha is the third of the “Three Gems”. When Buddhists take their
refuge in the Sangha they say: “Sangha saraṇa gacchāmi”, which means, “I
go for refuge to the Sangha”. The word “sangha” literally means
“congregation” or “community”. It is the word generally used for the
order of monks. However, the word “sangha” in connection with the third
Gem has a different meaning. The third Gem, the Sangha we take our
refuge in, is the “ariyan Sangha”, the community of all those who have
attained enlightenment. “Ariyan” or “noble person” is the name which
denotes all those who have attained one of the four stages of
enlightenment, no matter whether they are monks, nuns (bhikkhunī’s),
unmarried lay-followers or married lay-followers. In the suttas we read
that countless men and women lay-followers, single and married, attained
enlightenment[(22)](#FOOT22).

In order to understand what enlightenment is, we should first know more
about the accumulation of defilements. All kinds of defilements which
arise are conditioned; they are conditioned by akusala in the past.
Akusala citta which arises now conditions akusala citta again in the
future. Each citta which arises falls away completely and thus we may
wonder how there can be accumulation of defilements. Each citta which
arises falls away but it conditions the succeeding citta and this again
the next one. Since our life is a continuous series of cittas succeeding
one another, the process of accumulation continues in this series of
cittas, going on from moment to moment, from birth to death, and from
one life to the next life. That is the reason why there are conditions
at present for all kinds of defilements; they can arise at any time when
there are the right conditions.

The defilements which have been accumulated are very deeply rooted, and
they can only be eradicated in stages, at the different stages of
enlightenment. First the latent tendency of the clinging to the concept
of self has to be eradicated. The belief in a self can be eradicated by
understanding what it is we take for self, in developing vipassanā or
right understanding of realities. What we call “my body” are only
physical phenomena, rūpas, which arise and fall away and which we cannot
control. We read in the Kindred Sayings (III, Middle Fifty I, par 59,
The Five) that the Buddha said to his first five disciples in the
Deerpark of Vārānasi:

> Body, monks, is not the self. If body, monks, were the self, then body
> would not be involved in sickness, and one could say of body: “Thus
> let my body be. Thus let my body not be.”

The same is said about mental phenomena. What we take for “my mind” are
only mental phenomena, nāmas, which arise and fall away and which are
beyond control. There is no self who can direct them. The wrong view of
self we have accumulated throughout countless lives can be eliminated
only very gradually. The wisdom becomes keener as successive stages of
insight are attained during the development of vipassanā. When the first
stage of enlightenment is attained and nibbāna is experienced for the
first time, the wrong view of self is eradicated completely and there is
no more doubt about nāma and rūpa.

The first stage of enlightenment is the stage of the “stream­winner”, in
Pāli: “sotāpanna”. We read in the Kindred Sayings (III, Khandhavagga, Ch
XXV, Kindred Sayings on Entering, par 1, The Eye) that the Buddha said
to the monks:

> The eye, monks, is impermanent, changeable, becoming otherwise. The
> ear, monks, is impermanent, changeable. So is the nose, the tongue,
> the body, and the mind. It is impermanent, changeable, becoming
> otherwise...
>
> He, monks, who thus knows, thus sees these doctrines, is called
> “streamwinner, saved from destruction, assured, bound for
> enlightenment”.

The sotāpanna, the streamwinner, is bound for the last stage of
enlightenment, which is the stage of the arahat. At the first stage of
enlightenment, the stage of the sotāpanna, nibbāna is experienced and
defilements are eradicated, but not all defilements are eradicated yet.
There are still lobha, dosa and moha. The sotāpanna knows that there are
still conditions for akusala cittas, but he does not take them for self.
Although he still has defilements, he will never transgress the five
precepts; it has become his nature to observe them. He cannot commit a
deed which can cause rebirth in one of the woeful planes; he is “saved
from destruction” as we read in the above-quoted sutta. Those who are
not ariyans cannot be sure that they will not be reborn in a woeful
plane of existence, even if they have done many good deeds in this life.
One may have committed an evil deed in a past life which may cause
rebirth in an unhappy plane. Only ariyans can be sure that they will not
be reborn in an unhappy plane.

The sotāpanna has an unshakable confidence in the “Three Gems”: in the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. He has no doubts about the Path the
Buddha taught; he cannot delude himself about the right practice of
vipassanā. We are deluded about the right practice so long as we cling
to a self, when we want to induce the arising of awareness or when we
cling to results we are hoping for. The sotāpanna, however, is firmly
established on the Path to the last stage of enlightenment, the stage of
the arahat.

In the scriptures nibbāna has been described as the end of lobha, dosa
and moha, as the end of dukkha, as the end of rebirth, as the deathless.
When one reads this one may think that the attainment of enlightenment
and the experience of nibbāna only pertains to the arahat who has
realized the fourth and last stage of enlightenment and who will not be
reborn after he has passed away. However, at each of the four stages of
enlightenment nibbāna is experienced and defilements are eradicated,
until they are all eradicated at the last stage of enlightenment. The
ariyans who have not reached the stage of the arahat still have
defilements and they still have conditions to be reborn, but they are
sure to reach the end of defilements and the end of rebirth.

The sotāpanna has experienced nibbāna. It is difficult to understand and
define what nibbāna is. Nibbāna is the unconditioned dhamma, it does not
arise and fall away. All realities we experience in daily life arise
because of conditions and then fall away immediately. What arises and
falls away is dukkha, suffering or unsatisfactory. All conditioned
realities are impermanent, dukkha and anattā, non-self. Since nibbāna
does not arise and fall away it is not impermanent and thus not dukkha.
Nibbāna is not a person or self, it is anattā. Thus, all realities,
including nibbāna, are anattā. When paññā has been developed to the
degree that conditioned realities are clearly understood as they are, as
impermanent, dukkha and anattā, there can be enlightenment, the
experience of nibbāna. Nibbāna is the object of lokuttara citta,
supramundane citta, as we have seen in chapter 7. The lokuttara cittas
which experience nibbāna arise and then fall away immediately, they are
impermanent. After they have fallen away other types of cittas arise
which are not lokuttara cittas. So long as one has not eradicated all
defilements akusala cittas are bound to arise again.

The fact that the sotāpanna has attained enlightenment does not mean
that he cannot continue all his daily activities. The sotāpanna can live
with husband or wife and lead a family life. Ariyans who have not
attained the third stage of enlightenment, the stage of the
“non-returner” or “anāgāmī”, still have attachment to sense objects. As
regards the arahat, he has no inclinations at all for the layman’s life.

The sotāpanna does not take any nāma or rūpa for self, but there is
still attachment, aversion and ignorance; he still has conceit.
Therefore, he has to continue with the development of vipassanā. We read
in the Kindred Sayings (III, Khandhā-vagga, Last Fifty, II, par 122,
Virtue) that Mahā-Koṭṭhita asked Sāriputta what would be the object of
awareness for a virtuous monk who has not realized any stage of
enlightenment yet, or for a sotāpanna, or for those who have realized
the subsequent stages of enlightenment. Sāriputta explained that the
object of paññā is the five “khandhas of grasping”[(23)](#FOOT23), which
are all the nāmas and rūpas in and around oneself. Sāriputta said:

> “The five khandhas of grasping, friend Koṭṭhita, are the conditions
> which should be pondered with method by a virtuous monk, as being
> impermanent, suffering, sick, as a boil, as a dart, as pain, as
> ill-health, as alien, as transitory, empty and not self...
>
> Indeed, friend, it is possible for a virtuous monk so pondering with
> method these five khandhas of grasping to realize the fruits of
> stream-winning.”
>
> “But, friend Sāriputta, what are the things which should be pondered
> with method by a monk who is a sotāpanna?”
>
> “By a monk who is a sotāpanna, friend Koṭṭhita, it is these same five
> khandhas of grasping which should be so pondered.
>
> Indeed, friend, it is possible for a monk who is a sotāpanna…by so

>
> “But, friend Sāriputta, what are the things which should be pondered
> with method by a monk who is a once-returner?”
>
> “By one who is a once-returner, friend, it is these same five khandhas
> which should be pondered with method.
>
> Indeed it is possible, friend, for one who is a once-returner, by so
> pondering to realize the fruits of non-returning[(25)](#FOOT25).”
>
> “But, friend Sāriputta, what are the things which should be pondered
> with method by one who is a non-returner?”
>
> “By such a one, friend Koṭṭhita, it is these five khandhas of grasping

>
> “But what, friend Sāriputta, are the things which should be pondered

>
> “By an arahat, friend Koṭṭhita, these five khandhas should be pondered

> For the arahat, friend, there is nothing further to be done, nor is

The ariyan of the second stage, the once-returner or sakadāgāmī, has not
eradicated all attachment and aversion, but they have become attenuated.
He still has ignorance, which is only completely eradicated by the
arahat. The ariyan of the third stage, the non-returner or anāgāmī, has
eradicated aversion and he has eradicated attachment to the things
experienced through the five senses, but he has not eradicated all forms
of clinging; he still clings to rebirth and he still has conceit.

Ariyans who are not yet arahats can still have conceit, although they
have no wrong view of self. They may be inclined to pride while they
compare themselves with others. When a person thinks himself better
than, equal to or less than someone else, there can, even if it is true,
be conceit. Why should we compare ourselves with others? In the
Khemaka-sutta (Kindred Sayings III, Khandhā-vagga, Middle Fifty, Part 4,
par 89) we read that the monk Khemaka, who was staying in Jujube Tree
Park, was afflicted by sickness. Some other monks who were staying near
Kosambī in Ghosita Park, asked the monk Dāsaka to enquire after his
health. After he gave the message that his health was not improving, the
other monks told Dāsaka to ask Khemaka whether he still took anything
for self. When Khemaka had told Dāsaka that he did not take anything for
self, the other monks concluded that Khemaka must be an arahat. Khemaka
answered Dāsaka:

> “Though, friends, I discern in the five khandhas of grasping no self
> nor anything pertaining to the self, yet am I not arahat, nor one in
> whom the āsavas (cankers) are destroyed. Though, friend, I see that I
> have got the idea of ’I am’ in the five khandhas of grasping, yet do I
> not discern that I am this ’I am’.”
>
> Then the venerable Dāsaka returned to the monks with that message and
> reported the words of the venerable Khemaka (and those monks sent this
> further message): “As to this ’I am’, friend Khemaka, of which you
> speak, what do you mean by this ’I am’? Do you speak of ’I am’ as body
> or as distinct from the body? As feeling, or as distinct from feeling?
> As perception…as the “activities”…as consciousness, or as distinct
> from consciousness? As to this ’I am’, what do you mean by it?” (So
> the venerable Dāsaka went again and took the message in these words.)
>
> “Enough, friend Dāsaka. What boots this running to and fro! Fetch my
> staff. I will go myself to these monks.”
>
> So the venerable Khemaka, leaning on his staff, came to those monks.
> When he got there, he greeted them, and exchanging the courtesies of
> civil words, sat down at one side. As he thus sat, the elders thus
> spoke to the venerable Khemaka:
>
> “As to this ’I am’, friend Khemaka, of which you speak, what do you
> mean by it? Do you speak of it as body or as distinct from body…as
> consciousness, or as distinct from consciousness?”
>
> “No friends, I do not say, ’I am body or feeling, or perception, or
> the ’activities’ or consciousness, or as distinct from these and from
> consciousness.’ Though, friends, I see that I have got the idea of ’I
> am’ in the five khandhas of grasping, yet I do not discern that I am
> this ’I am’. Just as, friends, in the case of the scent of a blue

>
> “Surely not, friend.”
>
> “Then how would he be right in describing it?”
>
> “Surely, friend, by speaking of the scent of the flower.”
>
> “Even so, friends, I do not speak of the ’I am’ as a body, or as
> feeling and so forth. Nevertheless I see that in these five khandhas

>
> In this way, as he lives in the contemplation of the five khandhas of

Further on we read:

The arahat has eradicated all defilements and latent tendencies. He will
not be reborn when his life is terminated.

How can we find out who is an ariyan? There is no way to know who is an
ariyan, unless we have become enlightened ourselves. It cannot be known
from someone’s outward appearance whether he is an ariyan or not. People
who are very amiable and peaceful are not necessarily ariyans. However,
we can take our refuge in the ariyan Sangha even if we do not personally
know any ariyans. We can think of the virtues of the ariyans, no matter
whether they are in this plane of existence or in other planes. The
ariyans prove that there is a way to the end of defilements. We should
know what the condition is for the end of defilements: the development
of wisdom. The monks, nuns, men and women lay-followers who were ariyans
in the Buddha’s time proved that what the Buddha taught can be realized
in daily life. The Buddha did not teach abstract ideas, he taught
reality. Should those who want to realize the truth not walk the same
Path the ariyans walked, even if they still have a long way to go?

The ariyans understood very clearly that we cannot seek deliverance from
our defilements outside ourselves. Defilements can only be eradicated
where they arise: within ourselves. If we want to eradicate defilements
we should follow the eightfold Path which is the “Middle Way”. In order
to follow the “Middle Way” we do not have to change our daily life, we
do not have to follow a particular life-style or difficult practices. We
can be aware of nāma and rūpa during our daily activities. We will
experience that this may be more difficult than the practices of an
ascetic. It is harder to overcome the clinging to a self when we are
seeing, hearing or thinking, than to endure bodily hardship. The
development of wisdom is a life task. We need much courage and
perseverance in order to continue to be aware of realities of daily
life.

When we take our refuge in the ariyan Sangha we are expressing our
confidence in the Buddha’s Path, through which we may realize what the
Sangha has realized. We take our refuge in the Sangha also when we pay
respect to the monks, no matter whether they are ariyans or not, because
the goal of monkhood is to apply what the Buddha taught in order to
realize the truth and to try to help other people as well to realize the
truth. Thus the monks remind us of the “Three Gems”: the Buddha, the
Dhamma and the Sangha.
