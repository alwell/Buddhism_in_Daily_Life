The Highest Blessings 
=====================

In the Mahā-Maṅgala-sutta (The Highest Blessings, Sutta-Nipāta II, 4,
vs. 258 -270, Khuddaka Nikāya)[(52)](#FOOT52) we read that a deva came
to see the Buddha when he was staying at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery at
the Jeta Grove, and asked him what the highest blessing was. In reply
the Buddha spoke to him about the highest blessings. All the blessings
of a life full of Dhamma are to be found in this sutta. We read that the
Buddha said:

- Not to associate with fools, to associate with the wise, and to 
honour those who are worthy of honour -this is the Highest Blessing.
- To reside in a suitable locality, to have done meritorious actions
in the past, and to set oneself in the right course -this is the
Highest Blessing.
- Vast learning, (skill in) handicraft, a highly trained discipline,
and pleasant speech -this is the Highest Blessing.
- Supporting one’s mother and father, cherishing wife and children,
and peaceful occupations -this is the Highest Blessing.
- Liberality, righteous conduct, the helping of relatives, and
blameless actions -this is the Highest Blessing.
- To cease and abstain from evil, abstention from intoxicating drinks,
and diligence in virtue - this is the Highest Blessing.
- Reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude and the opportune
hearing of the Dhamma -this is the Highest Blessing.
- Patience, obedience, seeing the Samanas (holy men), and (taking part
in) religious discussions at proper times -this is the Highest
Blessing.
- Self-control, Holy Life, perception of the Noble Truths, and the
realisation of Nibbāna -this is the Highest Blessing.
- If a man’s mind is sorrowless, stainless, and secure, and does not
shake when touched by worldly vicissitudes -this is the Highest
Blessing.
- Those who thus acting are everywhere unconquered, attain happiness
  everywhere to them these are the Highest Blessings.

“Not to associate with fools, to associate with the wise, and to honour
those who are worthy of honour” is the first blessing. The last
blessing, which is the blessing of the arahat, cannot be attained if one
lacks the first blessing. If one does not know the right conditions for
enlightenment, nibbāna cannot be realized. We read in the Kindred
Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Book XI, Kindred Sayings on Streamwinning, Ch I,
par 5) that the Buddha asked Sāriputta to tell him what the conditions
are for “stream-winning”, the attainment of the first stage of
enlightenment. We read that Sāriputta answered:

> “Lord, association with the upright is a limb of stream-winning. Hearing
the good Dhamma is a limb of stream-winning. Applying the mind is a limb
of stream-winning. Conforming to the Dhamma is a limb of
stream-winning.“

Conforming to the Dhamma is applying the Dhamma, practising it. We
cannot hear the Dhamma, investigate the truth of it and practise it,
unless we have met the right person who can point out to us the meaning
of the Buddha’s teachings and the way to practise them.

Do we want to associate with foolish people or with wise people? It is
of no use to apply ourselves to mental development if we do not
scrutinise ourselves first with regard to this question. We are inclined
to associate with people who have the same ideas and who like or dislike
the same things as we ourselves. In the Kindred Sayings (II,
Nidāna-vagga, Ch XIV, Kindred Sayings on Elements, par 14) it is said
that “through an element” beings come together. In the teachings
realities are sometimes called “elements” (dhātu). An element is an
ultimate reality which has its own characteristic. Elements are devoid
of self. Our accumulated inclinations are like elements; the same
elements attract each other. We read:

Through an element it is, monks, that beings flow together, meet
together. Beings of low tastes flow together, meet together with them of
low tastes. They of virtuous tastes flow together, meet together with
them of virtuous tastes. So have they done in the past. So will they do
in the future. So do they now in the present.

When we are together with someone for a long time we cannot help being
influenced by him. If we have foolish friends who do not know the value
of kusala, who act and speak in an unwholesome way, it is to our
decline. We may not notice that we are under their influence, but
gradually we may find ourselves following their ways. If we have friends
who know the value of kusala, who are generous, perform good deeds and
speak in a wholesome way, it encourages us to more wholesomeness. The
Buddha pointed out the dangers of wrong friendship and the benefit of
righteous friendship.

Fools do not know what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. They praise
what should not be praised and do not honour to those who should be
honoured. For example, high esteem is given to the most beautiful woman
in the country or the world, or to persons who have the greatest skill
in the field of sports, or to the best actor or musician. Should we
disapprove of people who have beauty, strength or skill? We cannot force
ourselves not to admire them, but if we have right understanding of
kusala and akusala, we will know whether it is wholesome or unwholesome
to be attached to beauty, strength and skill. We will know whether these
things lead to the welfare of ourselves and others or not.

How confused is life if one is ignorant of the Dhamma. One does not know
what is wholesome and what is unwholesome; one does not know about cause
and effect in life. When one suffers one does not understand why this
has to happen. In everyone’s life there is at different times the
experience of pleasant objects and the experience of unpleasant objects
through the senses; there is the experience of the vicissitudes of life.
We read in the Gradual Sayings (Book of the Eights, Ch I, par 5, Worldly
Failings) about the “worldly conditions” (lokadhamma):

> Monks, these eight worldly conditions obsess the world; the world
> revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight?
>
> Gain and loss, fame and obscurity, blame and praise, contentment and
> pain…

How susceptible we are to those worldly conditions. We are so sensitive
to the way people treat us. We attach great importance to blame and
praise, to honour and dishonour. If we do not receive the honour we
think is due to us we feel slighted. We have feelings of bitterness
towards those who treat us badly. If we do not make the career in life
we were hoping for, or if work is assigned to us which we consider to be
beneath our dignity, we feel frustrated. There are many things in life
which cause us to feel irritated, depressed or angry. Is there one day
when everything goes according to our wishes, one day of perfect
happiness? When we do not have right understanding we are obsessed by
the “worldly conditions”; we are foolish people.

The Buddha pointed out the dangers of being enslaved to these worldly
conditions. To what does such enslavement lead? It leads to an unhappy
rebirth. Devadatta, who caused a schism in the order and who separated
from it with five hundred monks, was a fool; he was obsessed by the
worldly conditions and corrupted by evil friendship. We read in the
Gradual Sayings (Book of the Eights, Ch I, par 7, Devadatta) that the
Buddha, while he was staying on Vulture’s Peak, not long after the
departure of Devadatta, said to the monks:

> …Monks, mastered by eight wrong states, Devadatta, with his mind out
> of control, became one doomed to suffer in hell, in perdition,
> dwelling there a kappa[(53)](#FOOT53), irreprievable. By what eight?
>
> Mastered by gain…by loss…by fame…by obscurity…by honour... by lack of
> honour…by evil intentions…by evil friendship, with his mind out of
> control, Devadatta became one doomed to suffer in hell, in perdition,
> dwelling there a kappa, irreprievable...

Fools like Devadatta who are obsessed by worldly conditions cannot teach
Dhamma. They want others to follow them blindly. They do not lead people
to the Buddha’s teachings so that they can investigate the truth for
themselves. If we associate with fools we cannot develop right
understanding of our life. We will become more obsessed by the worldly
conditions and there will be no way for us to eradicate defilements.

The Buddha, “Teacher of devas and men”, taught out of compassion for the
world, not in order to have “gain, honour and praise” in return. He
pointed out that it is the Dhamma which is important, not the person who
teaches it. We read in the Kindred Sayings (III, Khanda-vagga, Kindred
Sayings on Elements, Middle Fifty, Ch IV, par 87, Vakkali) that the
Buddha visited Vakkali who was sick and who was so attached to the sight
of the Buddha. Vakkali said:

> “For a long time, lord, I have been longing to set eyes on the Exalted
> one, but I had not strength enough in this body to come to see the
> Exalted One.”
>
> “Hush, Vakkali! What is there in seeing this vile body of mine? He who
> sees the Dhamma, Vakkali, he sees me; he who sees me, Vakkali, he sees
> the Dhamma. Verily, seeing the Dhamma, Vakkali, one sees me; seeing
> me, one sees the Dhamma.
>
> As to this, what do you think, Vakkali? Is body permanent or
> impermanent?”
>
> “Impermanent, lord.”
>
> “Is feeling…perception, the activities, is consciousness permanent or
> impermanent?”
>
> “ Impermanent, lord.”
>
> “Wherefore, Vakkali, he who thus sees…he knows ’…for life in these
> conditions there is no hereafter’. “

Further on in this sutta we read that Vakkali took the knife in order to
kill himself. The Buddha told the monks that Vakkali had attained
arahatship before he died. He could become an arahat because he had
developed insight to that degree.

The wise person does not want others to follow him blindly, but he helps
them in such a way that they can realize the truth themselves, without
being dependent on him; this is the most effective way one can help
others. He leads them directly to the Buddha’s teachings and encourages
them to study the “Tipiṭaka”, the three Collections of the Vinaya, the
Suttanta and the Abhidhamma. Then they can have wise consideration of
the teachings and verify the Dhamma themselves. He points out the way by
which they can realize for themselves the truth of impermanence, dukkha
and anattā. The aim of the Buddha’s teachings is to see realities as
they are. So long as we have not realized the truth we take for
permanent what is impermanent, we take for happiness what is not
happiness, we take for self what is non-self.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (IV, Salāyatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on
Sense, First Fifty, Ch III, par 26, Comprehension) that the Buddha said:

> Without fully knowing, without comprehending the all, monks, without
> detaching himself from, without abandoning the all, a man is incapable
> of extinguishing dukkha.
>
> Without fully knowing, without comprehending, without detaching
> himself from, without abandoning what (all) is a man incapable of
> extinguishing dukkha?
>
> It is by not fully knowing the eye…objects…eye-consciousness...
> eye-contact…that pleasant or unpleasant or indifferent feeling... the
> tongue…savours…the body…touches…the mind...
> mind-objects...[(54)](#FOOT54) that a man is incapable of
> extinguishing dukkha. This is the all, monks, without fully knowing
> which…a man is so incapable.
>
> But by fully knowing, by comprehending, by detaching himself from, by
> abandoning the all, one is capable of extinguishing dukkha.

The Buddha pointed out the impermanence of seeing, hearing and all the
other realities which can be experienced through the six doors, in order
to remind people to be aware of the seeing at this moment, of the
hearing at this moment. If we are not mindful of seeing-consciousness
which appears at the present moment or of the other realities appearing
now, there will not be a precise understanding of their characteristics
and thus we will not be able to see them as they are. The wise person
does not teach a Dhamma which is different from the Buddha’s teachings.
He does not point out things which do not lead to the goal. He does not
discourage people from study and he does not discourage them from being
mindful during their daily activities. He encourages them to be mindful
of the reality appearing at the present moment, no matter where they are
and what they are doing. It is essential to find out whether the person
with whom we associate is the right friend in Dhamma or not. If he is
not the right person he cannot point out to us the way to see things as
they are. We will know that he is the right person if he helps us to
understand the characteristic of seeing which appears now, of hearing
which appears now, and of the other realities which present themselves
through the six doors. This is the way the Buddha taught as the one and
only way to eradicate the clinging to the concept of self, to see things
as they are. When there will be less attachment to the concept of self
we will know from our own experience that association with the wise is
the highest blessing.

To honour those who are worthy of honour is the highest blessing. The
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha are worthy of honour. The wise person
who taught us the development of the eightfold Path is worthy of honour.
How can we honour those who are worthy of honour in the most appropriate
way? We feel deep gratitude to the Buddha and we want to give expression
to our gratitude. We can honour him by following his last words:
“Transient are all the elements of being! Strive with earnestness!”
(Mahā-Parinibbāna-sutta, Dialogues of the Buddha II, no. 16). We should
not be heedless, we should be mindful of realities. Without the Buddha’s
teachings we could not be mindful at this moment and there would be no
way to eradicate defilements. The whole purpose of the teachings is the
eradication of defilements through the development of right
understanding. Therefore, each moment of mindfulness is the highest
possible way of respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.

“To reside in a suitable location” is among the highest blessings. We
cannot meet the good friend in Dhamma in just any place; wise people are
rare in the world. It is a great blessing to live in a country where
Dhamma is taught and practised, so that one has an opportunity to know
the Buddha’s teaching. There are many factors that have to coincide in
order to meet the right person. It is not by mere chance that we meet
him; it is conditioned by kamma, by good deeds which have been
performed.

When someone meets a wise person he may not be ready yet to receive the
Dhamma. It may not be the right time for him to listen to the Dhamma; he
may not be capable yet of wise consideration of the teachings. The
accumulation of wholesome deeds is very helpful for making us ready to
receive the Dhamma. “To have done meritorious actions in the past” is
among the highest blessings. We read in the “Thera-Therīgāthā” that the
men and women in the Buddha’s time who attained enlightenment had
accumulated meritorious deeds for aeon’s and that they had also listened
to the Dhamma preached by Buddhas of former times. We read, for example,
about Subhā (Commentary to the Therīgāthā, the Paramattha-Dīpanī,
commentary to Canto XII, 70, Subhā):

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and accumulating
good of age-enduring efficacy, so that she had progressively planted the
root of good and accumulated the conditions for emancipation, was, in
this Buddha era reborn at Rājagaha...

Subhā listened to the Buddha, developed insight and attained
enlightenment, even to the stage of the arahat. When we know about the
conditions necessary for wisdom to reach maturity we will be less
inclined to think that it is self who develops the eightfold Path. When
we read that men and women in the Buddha’s time had accumulated good of
“age-enduring efficacy”, that they had listened to the Dhamma preached
by former Buddhas, before they met the Buddha Gotama and attained
enlightenment, we are reminded not to be heedless at the present time.

The Buddha taught satipaṭṭhāna to monks, nuns, laymen and women
lay-followers. As regards the life of the monk, the Vinaya should not be
separated from satipaṭṭhāna. In the Buddha’s time the Vinaya and
satipaṭṭhāna were not separated. We read in the “Mahā-Maṅgala-sutta that
one of the highest blessings is “a highly trained discipline” (vinaya).
The commentary to this sutta (the Paramatthajotika) speaks about the
discipline of the layman, abstinence from the ten immoral
actions[(55)](#FOOT55), and about the discipline of the monk. The monk
who develops the eightfold Path will have a deeper understanding of the
Vinaya and he will observe the rules more perfectly. Each detail of the
Vinaya is full of meaning because the rules support the welfare of the
community of the monks, the Sangha, and help the monk to lead a pure
life; the rules help him to be considerate in his speech and actions, to
cause no trouble to others. The Vinaya teaches the monk to be watchful
in body, speech and mind. When we develop mindfulness there is
watchfulness as regards the six doors. Through right understanding of
nāma and rūpa we will come to know our subtle defilements and the danger
of even these defilements. The monk who develops satipaṭṭhāna will have
a deeper respect for the rules of the Vinaya which remind him to be
watchful, seeing danger in even the slightest faults. Thus we see that
Vinaya and satipaṭṭhāna should not be separated.

The monk who develops the eightfold Path and attains enlightenment will
not leave the order anymore and return to the “lower life”, the layman’s
life. We read in the Kindred Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Book I, Ch VI, par
12, The river) that the Buddha spoke by way of simile about the monk who
will not return to the layman’s life; he said that the river Ganges,
tending towards the east, cannot be made to change its course and tend
towards the west. We read:

Just so monks, if the rājah’s royal ministers or his friends or boon
companions or kinsmen or blood relatives were to come to a monk who is
cultivating and making much of the ariyan eightfold way, and were to
seek to entice him with wealth, saying: “Come, good man! Why should
these yellow robes torment you? Why parade about with shaven crown and
bowl? Come! Return to the lower life and enjoy possessions and do deeds
of merit” for that monk so cultivating and making much of the ariyan
way, return to the lower life is impossible. Why so? Because, monks,
that monk’s heart has for many a long day been bent on detachment,
inclined to detachment, turned towards detachment, so that there is no
possibility for him to return to the lower life...

The eightfold Path can change the lives of monks and laypeople. It can
change the relationship between parents and children, husband and wife,
relatives and friends. There is bound to be attachment and displeasure
or anger in one’s relationship with others, but when satipaṭṭhāna is
developed there will be less clinging to the concept of self and this
will bear also on our relationship with others. When other people treat
us badly we can remember that in the ultimate sense there is no self or
person who suffers, and that there is no person who behaves in a
disagreeable way. There are only nāma and rūpa arising because of
conditions.

We are still susceptible to the worldly conditions of gain and loss,
honour and dishonour, blame and praise, well-being and pain. It is
unavoidable that there are both pleasant and unpleasant experiences in
our life: one day there is blame, the next day there is praise. However,
when we learn that receiving blame or praise are only phenomena which
arise because of conditions and fall away immediately, we will gradually
attach less importance to them. We read in the Mahā-Maṅgala-sutta:

> “If a man’s mind is sorrowless, stainless, and secure, and does not
> shake when touched by worldly vicissitudes -this is the Highest
> Blessing.”
>
> Those who are arahats have a mind unruffled by worldly conditions,
> they are free from sorrow, free from defilements. Nothing can disturb
> the arahat any more. The sutta continues:
>
> “Those who are thus acting are everywhere unconquered, attain
> happiness everywhere -to them these are the Highest Blessings.”

We are not free from sorrow. So long as there is clinging to the concept
of self there is no end to lobha, dosa and moha. Our defilements are the
real cause of the suffering in our life, day after day. The
Mahā-Maṅgala-sutta tells us about the blessings of a life full of
Dhamma. We read about loving-kindness in the relationship between
parents and children, between husband and wife, between relatives and
friends. We read about righteous conduct, diligence in virtue,
reverence, humility, patience, self-restraint, a holy and pure life.
When we read about all these blessings we may feel at times discouraged
about the practice of the Dhamma. We are inclined to think that the
eightfold Path is too difficult and that we are too far from the
realization of the truth. We would like to have less lobha, dosa and
moha; but can we force ourselves not to be attached to pleasant things,
not to be disturbed by unpleasant things? We should always remember that
the Buddha became enlightened and taught the truth for our welfare and
happiness. The Buddha taught the Dhamma which can be practised in daily
life. “To set oneself in the right course” is among the highest
blessings. When we have associated with a wise person who can explain
the Dhamma to us, when we have listened to the Dhamma and carefully
considered it, we can set ourselves in the right course. Defilements
cannot be eradicated immediately, but if there is less ignorance of
realities we can experience that it is a blessing to have been able to
listen to the Dhamma. Through the development of satipaṭṭhāna the notion
of self will gradually decrease until it is finally eradicated. And,
thus, we will experience the highest blessings of the Dhamma.
